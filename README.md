# Magic Patterns - Vite Template

This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://www.magicpatterns.com/c/hzhfniixf8hpvugxxd6mht)

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit the `.env` file and fill in your UiPath configuration:
   - `VITE_UIPATH_BASE_URL`: Your UiPath Cloud URL
   - `VITE_UIPATH_SECRET`: Your JWT Bearer token from UiPath
   - `VITE_UIPATH_ORG_NAME`: Your UiPath organization name
   - `VITE_UIPATH_TENANT_NAME`: Your UiPath tenant name

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Environment Configuration

This application requires UiPath Cloud credentials to function properly. Make sure to:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in all required environment variables
3. Never commit the `.env` file to version control (it's already in `.gitignore`)
