This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://www.magicpatterns.com/c/hzhfniixf8hpvugxxd6mht)

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure NPM registry for UiPath packages**
   ```bash
   cp .npmrc.example .npmrc
   ```
   
   Edit the `.npmrc` file and replace `your_github_token_here` with your GitHub Personal Access Token that has `read:packages` permission.

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit the `.env` file and fill in your UiPath configuration:
   - `VITE_UIPATH_BASE_URL`: Your UiPath Cloud URL
   - `VITE_UIPATH_SECRET`: Your JWT Bearer token from UiPath
   - `VITE_UIPATH_ORG_NAME`: Your UiPath organization name
   - `VITE_UIPATH_TENANT_NAME`: Your UiPath tenant name

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Environment Configuration

This application requires UiPath Cloud credentials and GitHub package access to function properly. Make sure to:

1. Copy `.npmrc.example` to `.npmrc` and add your GitHub token
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in UiPath credentials
3. Never commit `.npmrc` or `.env` files to version control (they're in `.gitignore`)

## GitHub Token Setup

To access UiPath packages, you need a GitHub Personal Access Token with `read:packages` permission:

1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with `read:packages` scope
3. Copy the token to your `.npmrc` file
